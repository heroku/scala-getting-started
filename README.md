# scala/play-getting-started

A barebones Scala app (using the Play framework), which can easily be deployed to Heroku.

This application support the [Getting Started with Scala/Play on Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-scala) article - check it out.

## Running Locally

Make sure you have Play and sbt installed.  Also, install the [Heroku Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/).

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/heroku/scala-getting-started.git
$ cd scala-getting-started
$ sbt compile stage
$ heroku local
```

Your app should now be running on [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/).

## Deploying to Heroku

Using resources for this example app counts towards your usage. [Delete your app](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli-commands#heroku-apps-destroy) and [database](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-postgresql#removing-the-add-on) as soon as you are done experimenting to control costs.

By default, apps use Eco dynos if you are subscribed to Eco. Otherwise, it defaults to Basic dynos. The Eco dynos plan is shared across all Eco dynos in your account and is recommended if you plan on deploying many small apps to Heroku. Learn more about our low-cost plans [here](https://blog.heroku.com/new-low-cost-plans).

Eligible students can apply for platform credits through our new [Heroku for GitHub Students program](https://blog.heroku.com/github-student-developer-program).

```sh
$ heroku create
$ git push heroku main
$ heroku open
```
